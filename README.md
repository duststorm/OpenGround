====

Processorpins PD8 and PD9 are exposed via testpads and can be used as USART3_TX and USART3_RX.
I've attached a 4-in-1 multitransmitter module from banggood [http://www.banggood.com/2_4G-CC2500-A7105-Flysky-Frsky-Devo-DSM2-Multiprotocol-TX-Module-With-Antenna-p-1048377.html] to these pads and powered it from the 3,3V pad nearby.
Communication with the module is working and it can successfully bind to a receiver.
